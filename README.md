# Wall-AI
Wall-AI is an intelligent shopping assistant built directly into Walmart's website that revolutionizes the e-commerce experience with a real, scalable tech stack. Using advanced multi-agent AI architecture with LangChain and Gemini Pro, WallAI provides personalized, context-aware shopping assistance by understanding user behavior, product context, and real-time data to enhance decision-making.

WallAI understands user context by combining data from their current page (scraped via the browser DOM) with past shopping behavior using LangChain. This enables highly personalized, context-aware responses based on live product titles, prices, categories, and user history. The system employs specialized AI agents orchestrated through LangGraph to deliver comprehensive shopping support ‚Äî from product comparisons and review summaries to price tracking and customer service automation ‚Äî all seamlessly integrated into the existing Walmart shopping experience.
