### Frontend/Next.js Application
The main web application built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, providing the user interface for the Wall-AI system.

**Steps to Run:**
1. Clone the repository:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yugjindal22/Wall-AI.git
cd Wall-AI
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Configure the environment variables by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in the required details.
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

### Production Build
To create an optimized production build:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1. **Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yugjindal22/Wall-AI.git
cd Wall-AI
npm install
```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Configure your API keys and environment variables

3. **Run Development Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Start Designing:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Upload your room photo or start with a template
   - Let the AI agents guide you through the design process

## üé® AI Agents

Wall-AI employs several specialized AI agents:

- **Design Agent**: Analyzes room characteristics and suggests appropriate design styles
- **Color Agent**: Recommends color palettes based on lighting, room size, and user preferences
- **Pattern Agent**: Generates and suggests wall patterns and textures
- **Visualization Agent**: Creates realistic 3D previews and renderings
- **Coordination Agent**: Orchestrates communication between all agents for cohesive results
